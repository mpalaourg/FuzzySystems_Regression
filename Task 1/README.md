# Fuzzy Systems 3rd Assignment, AUTh [2019]
> Create a fuzzy TSK model to model multivariable, nonlinear functions.

> Dataset used	-> [CCPP Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant)

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Fuzzy Systems" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2019.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The goal is to find the best model parameters to fit the CCPP dataset. To this end 4 models were tested, where:
<ul>
  <li>Task Model 1 -> 2 Gaussian for input membership functions && Singleton (constant)   Output.</li>
  <li>Task Model 2 -> 3 Gaussian for input membership functions && Singleton (constant)   Output.</li>
  <li>Task Model 3 -> 2 Gaussian for input membership functions && Linear    (Polynomial) Output.</li>
  <li>Task Model 4 -> 3 Gaussian for input membership functions && Linear    (Polynomial) Output.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

## Status

As of the completion of the project, it will NOT be maintained. By no means should it ever be considered stable or safe to use, as it may contain incomplete parts, critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.

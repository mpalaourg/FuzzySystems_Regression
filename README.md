# Fuzzy Systems 3rd Assignment, AUTh [2019]
> Create a fuzzy TSK model to fit multivariable, nonlinear functions.

> Datasets used:

> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Task 1: [CCPP Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant) 

> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Task 2: [Superconductivty Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data)

> MATLAB Toolbox needed -> Fuzzy Logic Toolbox

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Fuzzy Systems" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2019.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The first dataset [TASK 1] will be used for a simple exploration of the training process and evaluation of such models and demonstrating ways of analyzing and interpreting the results. The second and more complex dataset [TASK 2] will be used for a more complete modeling process, which includes preprocessing steps, such as Features Selection, as well as methods for model optimization through cross validation.

## Status

As of the completion of the project, it will NOT be maintained. By no means should it ever be considered stable or safe to use, as it may contain incomplete parts, critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.
